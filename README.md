ag-Grid Angular Component Examples
===================

Examples of using ag-Grid with Angular and TypeScript

There are three example projects provided here, with each project having a dedicated README.md documenting how to use it:

* The first uses SystemJS for Just in Time compilation, and SystemJS Builder for AOT bundling. This can be found under the *systemjs_aot* folder.
* The second uses Webpack for bundling and includes both a dev and prod configuration. This can be found under the *webpack* folder.
* The third uses Angular-CLI for building and includes both a dev and prod configuration. This can be found under the *angular-cli* folder.

Note that the code examples (functionally) are the same in both projects, it's only the build and packaging mechanisms that are different.

Please read the README in each sub-folder for instruction how to build & run each sub-project.

See the [www.ag-grid.com](http://www.ag-grid.com) for an overview and full documentation.
