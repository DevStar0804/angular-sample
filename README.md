ag-Grid Angular Component Examples
===================

Examples of using ag-Grid with Angular and TypeScript

There are number of example projects provided here, with each project having a dedicated README.md documenting how to use it:

* The first uses SystemJS for Just in Time compilation, and SystemJS Builder for AOT bundling. This can be found under the *systemjs_aot* folder.
* The second uses Webpack for bundling and includes both a dev and prod configuration. This can be found under the *webpack* folder.
* The third uses Webpack 2 for bundling and includes both a dev and prod configuration. This can be found under the *webpack2* folder.
* The fourth uses Webpack 2 (with ngtools/webpack for AOT support) for bundling and includes both a dev and prod configuration. This can be found under the *ngtools_webpack* folder.
* The fifth uses Angular-CLI for building and includes both a dev and prod configuration. This can be found under the *angular-cli* folder.

Please read the README in each sub-folder for instruction how to build & run each sub-project.

**Note** The SystemJS example project has all of our Angular Examples included. The remaining projects only have a single 
example within just to illustrate how to build with that build tool.
