===================

Examples of using ag-Grid with Angular2 and TypeScript

There are three example projects provided here, with each project having a dedicated README.md documenting how to use it:

* The first uses SystemJS for Just in Time compilation, and SystemJS Builder for AOT bundling. This can be found under the *systemjs_aot* folder.
* The second uses Webpack for bundling and includes both a dev and prod configuration. This can be found under the *webpack* folder.
* The third uses Angular-CLI for building and includes both a dev and prod configuration. This can be found under the *angular-cli* folder.

Note that the code examples (functionally) are the same in both projects, it's only the build and packaging mechanisms that are different.
